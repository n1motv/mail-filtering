Description:

This Bash script automates the process of organizing emails in an inbox folder. It reads a list of spam email addresses from a file, then checks each email in the inbox against this list. If an email is identified as spam, it's moved to a designated spam folder; otherwise, it's moved to a hold folder. After processing, the script deletes the emails from the inbox. Additional features include usage instructions (-h or --help) and error handling for missing folders.
